# Card-Hangman
A hangman game in Python.

Project created in the trainee program of AI Operator at BeCode. 
The main objetive of the project is to create a hangman game in Python that is played in the terminal.
The project was assing to practice coding skilss such as learn project architecture, apply basic programming principles (loop, conditions, functions) and to reinforce Python syntax. 

What is the game about ? The Hangman game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting a letter.
n this implementation, does not have the drawing of the man being hanged. It is just the word with the letters appearing as more and more letters are guessed correctly.

After clone the repo all that is needed is run the command "python main.py" in the terminal and Game On!!!
